Description:
In rural Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) women are unable to leave their household unaccompanied. Traditionally, a woman's mother in law or husband accompany women to seek medical services. However, in the case of a medical emergency the woman's mother in law or husband may be unavailable. This service teams up women in rural KPK with companions, elderly women within that village or a nearby village, who she can contact in an emergency situation. These elderly women will accompany the young women to a health facility. The service focuses on medical emergencies that may occur during pregnancy.
